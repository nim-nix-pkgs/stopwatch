## Creates a new Stopwatch.  It has no laps and isn't running.  If you want to
## turn of lapping then pass `false` to the `enableLapping` paramater.  By
## default it is on.
proc stopwatch*(enableLapping:bool): Stopwatch =

## Clones the state of an existing Stopwatch.  Will copy over it's laps and if
## it is currently running or not.

    recordLaps: sw.recordLaps,

    laps: sw.laps,
    total: sw.total

## Checks to see if the Stopwatch is measuring time.
proc running*(sw: var Stopwatch): bool =
  return sw.running


## Makes the Stopwatch measure time.  Will do nothing if the Stopwatch is
## already doing that.
proc start*(sw: var Stopwatch) =
  # If we are already running, ignore
  if sw.running:
    return

  # Start the lap
  sw.running = true

## Makes the Stopwatch stop measuring time.  It will record the lap it has
## taken.  If the Stopwatch wasn't running before, nothing will happen

  # First thing, measure the time
  let stopTicks = getTicks_internal()

  # If not running, ignore

## lapping is enabled) and will stop the stopwatch.

## recording time.  It is the same as calling reset() then start().

## Checks to see if a stopwatch it recording laps or not.  Returns true if so,
## false otherwise
proc isRecordingLaps*(sw: var Stopwatch;): bool =
  return sw.recordLaps

## Returns the number of laps the Stopwatch has recorded so far.  If `incCur` is
## set to `true`, it will include the current lap in the count.  By default it
## set to `false`.
##
## If lapping is not enabled, this will 0

## Returns the time (in milliseconds) of a lap with the provided index of `num`.
## If `incCur` is set to `true`, it will include the current lap in the range
## (as the last lap).  By default it is set to `false`.  This function can raise
## an `IndexError` if `num` isn't a valid lap index.
##
## If you want to convert the returned value to a different time measurement,
## use one of the functions: `msecs()`, `usecs()` or `secs()`.
##
## If lapping is not enabled then this will return 0
proc lap*(sw: var Stopwatch; num: int; incCur: bool = false): int =

## Returns a list of all the recorded laps (in milliseconds).  If `incCur` is set
## `true`, then it will include the current lap in the result.  By default it is
## `false`.  If no lap is being recored, than `incCur` will be ignored.
##
## If you want to convert the returned value to a different time measurement,
## use one of the functions: `msecs()`, `usecs()` or `secs()` in conjunction
## with the `map()` function from the `sequtils` module.  Example:
##
## .. code-block:: nim
##   var sw = stopwatch()
##
##   # some time measurements later...
##
##   var lapsSecs = sw2.laps.map(proc(x: int): float = secs(x))
##   echo lapsSecs
##   # --> @[1.000117, 0.500115, 0.200212]
##
## If lapping is turned off this will return an empty sequence

## Removes a lap from the Stopwatch's record with the given index of `num`.
## This function has the possibility of raising an `IndexError`.
##

    return

  # Remove its time from the accum
  let t = sw.laps[num]
  sw.total = sw.total.Ticks - t

  sw.laps.delete(num)


## This clears out all of the lap records from a Stopwatch.  This will not
## effect the current lap (if one is being measured).
##
## If lapping is disabled nothing will happen.

  # Check for no laps
  if not sw.isRecordingLaps:
    return

  sw.laps.setLen(0)
  sw.total = 0

## This will return either the length of the current lap (if `stop()` has not
## been called, or the time of the previously measured lap.  The return value is
## in milliseconds.  If no laps have been run yet, then this will return 0.
##
## If lapping is turned off then this will act the same as `totalMsecs()`
